# New Tech Zone GitHub URL - Notice

**Author:** [Phil Wiffen](https://twitter.com/phil_wiffen)

## We're moving

The Tech Zone contributor location is moving from

<https://github.com/martinzugec-ctx/en-us-tech-zone>

To

<https://github.com/citrixtechzone/en-us-tech-zone>

## Why is this happening?

This will give Citrix a central place for contributors to submit to, that doesn’t have an individual owner.

## What exactly is changing, and what isn't?

Tech Zone is moving from contributors creating content in a Github organisation owned by an individual (martinzugec-ctx), to a Github organisation owned by the Tech Zone team (citrixtechzone).

This will mean that you will need to change where you clone from and push to. But it doesn't change the general contribution process.

## What do I need to do?

You’ll need to migrate your development environment to the new repository under <https://github.com/citrixtechzone/en-us-tech-zone>

If you use GitHub Desktop and Visual Studio Code, we have prepared a migration guide for this: [Migration Guide](new-development-url-migration-guide.html).

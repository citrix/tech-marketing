# Citrix Tech Zone - Social Media Role

**Author:** [Martin Zugec](https://twitter.com/martinzugec)

## Mission Statement

Social media promotion is done for all new content released on Citrix Tech Zone and also for updated content (if change is significant and deserves attention, for example adding new chapters to existing documents).

![Tech Zone process overview](/media/role-social-media-overview.jpg)

Few best practices for social media promotions:

*  Content does not always need to be promoted on the day it has been released
*  Do not promote more than 1 article per day
*  Do not promote content on Friday or weekend
*  Content should be promoted in morning hours (EST time)
*  Always try to include image from article in social media. If there are no good diagrams, use a screenshot of article itself
*  Use #CitrixTechZone tag (for reporting/analytics)

All content is promoted on following sites:

*  [Facebook - Citrix SME](https://www.facebook.com/groups/280077812059062/)
*  [Facebook - Citrix Certified](https://www.facebook.com/groups/citrix.certified/)
*  [LinkedIn - Citrix Professionals](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/111929/)
*  [LinkedIn - Citrix Certified Professionals](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/89816/)

It is recommended to promote it on following personal social networks:

*  [Twitter - Personal](https://twitter.com/home)
*  [LinkedIn - Personal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/)

Finally, all content should be added to following Citrix channels:

*  [tm_and_compete_news](https://citrix.slack.com/archives/CLT8ZKK9R)
*  [SocialChorus (technical and Tech Zone channels)](https://studio.socialchorus.com/programs/10177/b2)

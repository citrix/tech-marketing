## Overview

Using GitHub Desktop and Visual Studio Code helps simplify the creation of Tech Zone content. A set of rules is added to Visual Studio Code to validate proper markdown settings. In order to use this, the local environment must be set up and configured. This guide provides the steps needed to configure.

## Visual Studio Code Setup

1. Download and install Visual Studio code: [Visual Studio Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Once installed, launch Visual Studio Code to install the correct extension. This extension, when configured properly, will look for errors in the markdown language.

1. Search for the extension "markdownlint". Install
1. In the local file system, navigate to `%AppData%\Code\User` (Windows) or `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User` (Mac OS).
1. Create a file called "settings.json"
1. Edit settings.json in Notepad. Paste in the following rules (including the brackets)

```text
{

"git.enableSmartCommit": true,

"git.confirmSync": false,

"git.autofetch": true,

"markdownlint.config": {

"MD003": { "style": "atx" },

"MD007": { "indent": 4 },

"MD009": { "br_spaces": 2 },

"MD013": false,

"MD024":false,

"MD026": { "punctuation": ".,;:!" },

"MD030": { "ul_single": 2,

"ol_single": 2,

"ul_multi": 2,

"ol_multi": 2 },

"MD033": true,

"MD040": false,

}
```

1.  Save and close "settings.json"
1.  Close Visual Studio Code

**Note:** You can also download extension [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one). This extension adds various features to VSC, including ability to use common keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + B), table of contents, auto preview or simplified link creation.

## GitHub Desktop Setup

1. Download GitHub Desktop [GitHub Desktop Download](https://desktop.github.com)
1. When prompted, sign in to GitHub
1. Select the Tech Zone repository and select clone. This process will take some time as a full clone of the Tech Zone is being stored on your endpoint.

1. As you edit, you can see an in-app preview of the page by typing the following key combination: In Windows use `Ctrl+K`, then type `V`. In Mac OS, use `Command+V`. 
1. As you edit in markdown, errors are shown with a squiggly line.  There is a warning triangle icon in the lower left identifying how many markdown errors are detected. Selecting the triangle provides additional details on the errors.

1. If you select the triangle in the Problems section, Visual Studio Code will fix many of the errors for you.

1. Once done modifying the GitHub page, select File - Save within Visual Studio Code.
1. Close Visual Studio Code
1. GitHub Desktop is now visible. You can see the changes you made to the current branch. Add a brief description and select Commit.

1. These changes are only stored locally. You need to push them to GitHub by selecting "Push Origin".

You can continue modifying files within this branch according to your project. Once done and ready to publish, make sure the final updates are pushed to origin, then inform the Slack channel for publication.

Once the upload to GitHub is complete, verify the page renders properly by going to page within the browser.
